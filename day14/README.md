the program starts by asking the user how many customers will book rooms in the hotel

it uses a while loop to handle each customer one by one without using arrays or functions

for every customer it takes input like name room type and number of days of stay

it then asks if the customer wants breakfast wifi or gym services

it calculates the base fare by multiplying the room rate with the number of days

extra charges are added for any selected services based on daily rates

a discount of ten percent is applied if the subtotal is greater than ten thousand

gst of twelve percent is added after discount to get the final bill

after each customer bill is printed immediately showing all details

at the end the program shows total rooms booked total revenue and highest and lowest bills
