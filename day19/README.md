this code manages student records using simple arrays and loops only.

it first reads names, then fills attendance and marks in two matrices.

a loop shows a menu repeatedly so the user can check different reports.

displaying matrices just prints the stored values in row-column form.

attendance calculations count present and absent values for every student.

by comparing these counts, the program finds who came the most and who came the least.

marks calculations total the scores of each student and compute average marks.

using these totals, the program identifies the topper and lowest performer.

grades are assigned by checking the average against fixed grade ranges.

the menu loop ends only when the user chooses option 6.
