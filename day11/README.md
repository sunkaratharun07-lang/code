the program begins by asking the user to enter an initial balance
it checks that the starting balance is at least five hundred before continuing
a men is displayed with four choices check balance deposit withdraw and exit
the program uses a while loop to keep showing the menu until the user exits or reaches five transactions
when the user chooses check balance it shows the current amount available
when the user chooses deposit it asks for an amount and adds it to the balance if the value is positive
when the user chooses withdraw it checks that the amount is positive and that five hundred remains after withdrawal
if the user enters an invalid number or choice it shows a message and asks again
each valid operation increases the transaction counter
when five transactions are completed the session ends automatically
before closing the program shows the total number of transactions and the final balance
the program uses only basic input output statements loops and conditional logic without arrays or functions
